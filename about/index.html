			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Howdy! I'm Andrew, I'm from King of Prussia, PA, and I'm 19 years old. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Lehigh University's College of Engineering, as well as a B.A. in Music/Jazz in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am also planning on working towards a minor in Graphic Design.</p>
			<p>My passion in CS is front end development, although I haven't spent too much time working on it, other than a project I worked on called Liquick, which you can check out below. I am familiar with programming in Java, HTML, C, and C++, so I am comfortable with backend work as well.</p>
			<p>As fas ar music goes, I'm studying jazz saxophone with Dave Riekenberg, and perform in Lehigh's Jazz Ensemble (tenor sax) and Tim Harrison's Jazz Combo (baritone sax). Beyond jazz, I am also interested in classical study, I am in Lehigh's Wind Ensemble and Clarinet Choir on Contra-Alto Clarinet, and am a founding member of the university's new Sax Quartet, where I manage the group, choose music, and play baritone sax. I'm also a proud member of the Marching 97!</p>
			<p>Some personal interests of mine are music production/transcription, gaming (mostly PC and Switch right now), and streaming. You can check below for links to these sites.</p>
